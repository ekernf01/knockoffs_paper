## Calibrating gene regulatory network inference

This is an internal repository to support our analysis of model-X knockoffs for inference of gene regulatory networks. 

- `applications`: contains code to remake figures, especially for the DREAM5 E. coli and mouse SHARE-seq examples. 
- `writing`: contains mathematical derivations, PDF's of related papers, and slides from internal presentations.
